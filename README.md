# Introduction
This project focuses on using SONAR data to classify objects as rocks or mines. It demonstrates how to preprocess data, train a logistic regression model, and make predictions. The project provides insights into data analysis, model evaluation, and prediction.

# Data
The SONAR data used in this project consists of multiple features that characterize each object. These features are numerical values obtained from SONAR readings. The dataset contains a total of 208 instances.

# Usage
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yyigitturan/rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd your-repo

Results
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 83.4% on the training data and 76.2% on the test data. The model's predictions can be used to classify objects as rocks or mines based on SONAR data.
